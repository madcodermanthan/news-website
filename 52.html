Amazon basin has witnessed tremendous changes in the last four decades, at a scale seen “nowhere else in the world”, scientists have found using American National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (Nasa) satellite imagery. 

Scientists from the University of Maryland found that the region, which is home to world’s largest rainforest, has experienced great losses in forests land, due to deforestation; and increase in pasture land, according to Nasa's Earth Observatory.

A shift in land use policy driven by economic forces also affected its ecology, they added. 

The Amazon rainforest is home to a fifth of the world’s land species and more than 30 million people, including hundreds of indigenous people. It is also a great source of carbon sink.

However, the region is a complex and challenging place for remote sensing scientists to study due to intersecting and overlapping ecosystems, the Earth Observatory reported.

To better understand, the team mapped the Amazon basin using satellite imagery (using Nasa's Landsat 7 and 8) and collected a mosaic of cloud-free images. The map uses false colour satellite imagery to illustrate the varied landcover types in and around the Amazon rainforest.
