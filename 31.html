PV Sindhu drops to world no 6, P Kashyap jumps to 25th spot
World champion P V Sindhu slipped a place to the sixth spot after a poor run in the last two weeks but former Commonwealth Games champion Parupalli Kashyap continued his good run, breaking into the top 25 in the latest BWF ranking on Tuesday.

Olympic silver medallist Sindhu, who made early exits at the China Open and Korea Open, dropped to world no 6 spot after five months and the former world no 2 shuttler will look to make amends at the Denmark Open and French Open.

Former world no 6, Kashyap was rewarded for his creditable semifinal finish at last week’s Korea Open Super 500 event as he improved five places to reach the world no 25 spot.

“I am feeling good. I need to maintain fitness and keep working hard. May be, now top 20 by year end can be possible,” Kashyap told PTI.
