Ashwin, who has an impressive Test record with 342 wickets from 65 matches, lost his place in the playing XI to Ravindra Jadeja when it came to playing outside the Indian sub-continent.

The 33-year-old will start afresh when he dons the national colours after 10 months against the Proteas in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday.

“Ashwin is one of the leading bowlers. And he has done well not with just the ball but also contributed by scoring crucial runs. So, I think he is an integral part of this Indian team without any doubt,” Tendulkar told PTI during an exclusive interaction.
